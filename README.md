# Note-taker

This is a note taking app that allows users to save notes on a remote server. The user will hit start and will be taken to a different HTML page with where they
can add their notes to. The user would be prompted to write the title of a section and write their notes. Once they are done, they will hit the save feature on the
top right hand corner. Then the section title will be added to the right side. The user can click on those sections to review their notes. The user could also add 
more notes by clicking the plus symbol on the top right hand corner.
